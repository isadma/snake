The Snake Game

The Snake Game using Python and the Turtle package is a fun and interactive computer game. In this game, the player controls a snake using the W, S, D, and A keys on their keyboard. The goal is to make the snake move around the screen and eat food while avoiding obstacles.

The snake is represented by a series of connected segments and moves by changing its position and direction. The food is represented as a dot on the screen, and the snake grows whenever it eats it. The game ends when the snake hits a wall or one of its own segments.

The Turtle package provides an easy-to-use interface for controlling the movement of the snake and detecting collisions. The player controls the snake with the W, S, D, and A keys and the game logic is implemented using simple programming commands.

Overall, the Snake Game is a fun and educational project for those looking to learn more about programming in Python and creating simple games.
